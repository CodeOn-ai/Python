# Hello World!


# In python you can commet in your code in two ways, using '#' or ... 

"""
Using triple quotes

Single line comment use #, for a block use the quotes 


"""
# In python you do not need to specify the type like in c++


a = 4 # int
b = 5.4 # float 
c = True # Boolean
d = (3 +4j) # complex number
e = "String" # string

# to print in your interpreter you will need to use the in built function print

print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
print(d)
print(e)

# you can verify the types as well with function type()

print(type(a))
print(type(b))
print(type(c))
print(type(d))
print(type(e))
